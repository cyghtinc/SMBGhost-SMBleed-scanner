## Usage

`SMBGhost-SMBleed-scanner.py target_ip`

The scanner will report whether the target machine is vulnerable to SMBGhost and/or SMBleed.

**Note:** The scanner will crash the target machine if it's running an unpatched Windows 10 version 1903. The crash is caused by a null dereference bug which is fixed by the **KB4512941** update.
